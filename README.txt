Hello

My game can be run on a windows machine from the build in the RELEASE folder.
All code and assets are contained in the WAKINYAN folder and subfolders
The project can be rebuilt in visual studio 2013 by opening the solution file and rebuilding


Please Enjoy and if there are any problems please contact me at:
